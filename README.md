# Drag-less Keypoints (Presentation Notes)

## Traditional iOS Development Problem
* `@IBOutlet` `@IBAction` linkage NOT compile time safe

* Nib/Xib/Storyboard merge conflict. 100% of time NOT guarantee to be safe

* Storyboard `prepareForSegue` `loadNib` breaks OOP.  Views or ViewController always has NO self-documented schema (Constructor) to follow.

*  Interface builder settings cannot be replicated


> Work Around ? (Automated UI Test/ 100% Test Coverage) OR Solve the Problem fundamentally?


(DEMO) Let audience guess the result, safe to run / compile fail / crash app?

* delete `Button` in Interface builder
* delete `@IBOutlet`
* Try to rename `@IBOutlet`
* delete function `@IBAction`
* Copy & past IB Button (contains IBAction) to another view


## What can you experience if a project is easy to maintain?
* Consistent
* Predictable
* Code are easy to delete
* Easy to refactor

## Facts in Traditional iOS Development
* We are developer not designer

* Xcode is too slow to render storyboard

* Dynamic changing UI through User action is very common

* Mixing Static(via IB) & Dynamic(via Code) makes project inconsistent and not predictable

* Impossible to preview Dynamic UI



## How do our patterns solve?

* We use `RxSwift` consistently to handle all the events that emitted from a View.
`RxSwift` simplifies how we handle events (but high learning curve).

* We strictly decouple all views in a `DraglessUIKit`. All views are portable to other projects.


* We use `SnapKit` as our auto-layout engine (There are lots of choices you can pick instead of SnapKit). All dynamic/static layouts are consistently written in code and always be found in `DraglessUIKit`. By the nature of human-writing instead of generated by Interface Builder, git merge-conflict is much easier to resolve.


* We think that "Save & Preview" is very important when developing a UI. Thus, We use Xcode + `@IBDesignable` (found `Preview.xib`). Also, all dynamic layout can also be previewed by changing the `XXXView` state in `prepareForInterfaceBuilder`

* We build extensions for `prepareForInterfaceBuilder` (IBHelper). i.e. drawing the boundaries of each view, recursively render all children view, 10 items for tableView

* We use `TypedViewControllerType` to bound developers strictly. By the protocol definition,  `XXXViewController` must own `XXXView`. Accessing `typedView` without any worries. No `@IBOutlet` is needed anymore when you use

* We use `XXXViewControllerLaunching` protocol to provide a schema for launching the corresponding ViewController. All ViewController should own their own `launcher`. (see in MainViewController)

* As the project has no @IBOutlet/@IBAction, 100% Compile time safe. We heavily use Intellij Refactor features in Swift (Mostly for variable/function rename)

* We heavily use Intellij AppCode Live Template features to utilize this pattern as fast as possible.

This is our foundation. We had built lots of advance work based on this foundation but NOT appear in this project (i.e. How we utilize RxSwift, or declarative approach to handle view state, maybe on next sharing). But, I think this sample project can already provided enough insight to build a high quality and maintainable iOS Project.
